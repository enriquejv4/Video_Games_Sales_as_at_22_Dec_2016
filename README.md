# Video Games Sales as at 22 December 2016

Postgres' database from Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv

You could find [Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings?resource=download) on Kaggle,
however, I will use a modified version of this csv to fill my postgres database. In this modified version I deleted some 'N/A' from Year_of_Release column
and some 'tbd' from User_Score column.
