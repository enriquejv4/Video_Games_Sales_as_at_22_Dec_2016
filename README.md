You could find [Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings?resource=download) on Kaggle,
however, we will use a modified version of this csv to fill our postgres database. In this modified version we deleted all cells with 'N/A' from *Year_of_Release* column
and all cells with 'tbd' from *User_Score column*.

In postgres.txt you can see the construction of the postgres' database.

From line 3 to line 64 of postgres.txt we are creating the database's tables. The main table is *videogames* and the rest of the tables are for optimize our database.

In line 67 we are importing Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016 to *videogames* table.

From line 70 to 83 we are updating secondary tables.

From line 87 to 91 we are dropping updated columns from *videogames* table.

Finally, from line 94 we are crossing our tables to show our final result.
